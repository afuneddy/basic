# basic


Problem:
Give an O(n+m) time algorithm deciding whether a sequence X = x1 . . . xn
is a subsequence of Y = y1 . . . ym. Remember to explain how your algorithm works!

I think what I have here should run  at O(m). Basically, It is the total number of times the while loop is executed, which is m.
